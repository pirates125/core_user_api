## Core User API

A minimal backend API built with Node.js (without frameworks),
focused on clean architecture, HTTP fundamentals and backend best practices.

### Goals

- Understand request lifecycle
- Separation of concerns (Router / Controller / Service)
- Proper error handling
- Predictable API design

### Why this project exists

This project is not built to showcase a framework or a technology.

It exists to deeply understand how a backend system works at its core:

- how HTTP requests flow through a system
- how responsibilities are separated
- how errors, validation and data are handled
- how production-ready thinking is applied step by step

Everything is built using plain Node.js on purpose.
Frameworks are intentionally avoided to prevent hiding fundamental concepts.

The goal is not to build many features,
but to build the right mental model behind a backend application.

This repository reflects a learning process focused on:

- system thinking
- clean architecture
- predictable behavior
- long-term maintainability
